# Government Measures Dataset

## General information

- **Description**: The **Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker** (OxCGRT) Dataset, provides a systematic way to
track the stringency of government responses to COVID-19 across countries and time. Using a novel index that combines
various measures of government responses, the authors describe variation in government responses, explore whether rising
 stringency of response affects the rate of infection, and identify correlates of more or less stringent responses.


OxCGRT collects publicly available information on 13 indicators of government response (S1-S13). Nine of the indicators
(S1-S7, S12 and S13) take policies such as school closures, travel bans, etc. are recorded on an ordinal scale;
the remainder (S8-S11) are financial indicators such as fiscal or monetary measures.
